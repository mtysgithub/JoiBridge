# JoiBridge
"Joi" is inspired by the artificial intelligence female character Joi in "Blade Runner 2049". It uses ChatGPT and Azure Speech Services to provide one-stop voice dialogue process service.

To install the Speech SDK in a new project using .NET CLI, use the command "dotnet add package Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech".
